    "\n",
    "### **Motivation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Experimental errors limit the depth of quantum circuits that can be executed on near-term devices. Operator backpropagation is a technique that involves absorbing operations from the end of a quantum circuit into a Pauli operator, generally reducing the depth of the circuit at the cost of additional terms in the operator. The goal is to backpropagate as much of the circuit as possible without allowing the operator to grow too large.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to allow for deeper backpropagation into the circuit, while preventing the operator from growing too large, is to truncate terms with small coefficients rather than adding them to the operator. Truncating terms can result in fewer quantum circuits to execute, but doing so results in some error in the final expectation value calculation proportional to the magnitude of the truncated terms' coefficients. You can find the [OBP docs here](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/guides/qiskit-addons-obp), an example of using [OBP on a 50-qubit Heisenberg spin chain](https://learning.quantum.ibm.com/tutorial/improving-estimation-of-expectation-values-with-operator-backpropagation), and the API reference docs for [Qiskit addon utils here](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit-addon-utils)\n",
