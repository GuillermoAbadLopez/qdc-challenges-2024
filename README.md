# IBM Quantum Developer Conference 2024

Welcome to the **IBM Quantum Developer Conference 2024!** To ensure you have the best challenge experience possible it is very important to follow the preparations steps outlined in this GitHub README prior to the event.

## Installation and Setup
Please bring your own laptop that you can connect to the internet. Laptops will not be provided at the venue.

### Have your IBM Quantum Platform account
To get one, go to the [IBM Quantum login page](https://quantum.ibm.com/login). **You must sign up with the same email you used to register for the event.** Your user account is associated with one or more [instances](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/guides/instances) (in the form `hub/group/project`) that gives access to IBM Quantum services, and all event attendees will be added to a specific instance for the duration of QDC.

### Set up a Python enviornment
Follow the steps [here](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/guides/install-qiskit#install-the-qiskit-sdk-and-the-qiskit-runtime-client) to create a Python environment and install the Qiskit SDK and Qiskit Runtime. We will be using Jupyter notebooks for the challenges, so please make sure to follow step 4 of the install guide.

Make sure to also install these additional packages in your Python environment:
- The Qiskit Functions catalog client (see install instructions [here](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/guides/functions#install-qiskit-functions-catalog-client))
- The Qiskit Transpiler Service client (see install instructions [here](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/guides/functions#install-the-qiskit-ibm-transpiler-package))

> **Alternative environment option:**
If you are not able to set up a Python environment or run Jupyter notebooks directly on your laptop, you may use an online lab environment (such as Google Colab or QBraid instead). See [here](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/guides/online-lab-environments) for more information. If you opt for this method, ensure that your online lab environment has the latest version of the packages in this [requirements](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qdc-challenges-2024/requirements.txt) file.

Lastly, download this [requirements](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qdc-challenges-2024/requirements.txt) file or use one of the following commands to set up a `requirements.txt` file.

#### macOS or Linux
```bash
{
echo "qiskit"
echo "qiskit-ibm-runtime"
echo "qiskit-ibm-transpiler"
echo "qiskit-ibm-catalog"
echo "qiskit[visualization]"
echo "jupyter"
} > path/to/requirements.txt
```

#### Windows
```bash
(
echo qiskit
echo qiskit-ibm-runtime
echo qiskit-ibm-transpiler
echo qiskit-ibm-catalog
echo qiskit[visualization]
echo jupyter
) > c:\path\to\requirements.txt
```

## Before the challenge
Make sure your installed packages are up to date with the latest versions. Do this immediately before the challenge! ðŸŽ‰

#### macOS or Linux
```bash
pip install -r path/to/requirements.txt --upgrade
```

#### Windows
```bash
pip install -r c:\path\to\requirements.txt --upgrade
```
